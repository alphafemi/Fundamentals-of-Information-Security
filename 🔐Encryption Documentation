Encryption Documentation
Encryption scrambles data so only authorized parties can access it. This guide explains symmetric and asymmetric encryption, their differences, and real-world applications. Based on the transcript, it uses the Alice and Bob analogy to illustrate concepts, emphasizing secure key management.

What is Encryption?
Encryption transforms readable data (plaintext) into unreadable form (ciphertext) using algorithms and keys.
Purpose: Protects sensitive information from unauthorized access.
Types: Symmetric (shared key) and asymmetric (public/private keys).

Symmetric Encryption
Uses a single shared key for encryption and decryption.
Process: Alice encrypts a document with a passphrase; sends it to Bob.
Problem: Sharing the key securely (e.g., via email) risks interception, allowing attackers to decrypt messages.
Analogy: Like a shared lock; anyone with the key can open it.
Limitations: Key distribution is insecure for remote parties.

Asymmetric Encryption
Uses a key pair: public key (shared) and private key (secret).
Key Generation: Algorithms like RSA create mathematically linked public/private keys.
Properties:
Public key encrypts data; private key decrypts it.
Keys are linked but cannot be derived from each other.
Analogy: Mailbox—address (public key) is known to all; only owner has the key (private key) to open it.

How Asymmetric Encryption Works
Alice and Bob securely exchange messages without sharing a secret key.
Step 1: Exchange public keys (e.g., Bob gives his to Alice; Alice gives hers to Bob).
Step 2: Alice encrypts the document with Bob's public key and sends it.
Step 3: Bob decrypts using his private key.
Security: Only Bob can read it; Alice can't decrypt her own message without Bob's private key.
Key Protection: Private keys must be safeguarded; theft allows decryption of messages intended for the owner.

Uses of Asymmetric Encryption
Widely used for secure communications and transactions.
HTTPS: Secures websites; browsers use asymmetric encryption for initial handshake.
PGP (Pretty Good Privacy): Encrypts emails securely.
Bitcoin: Protects wallets; only the owner (with private key) can transfer funds.
