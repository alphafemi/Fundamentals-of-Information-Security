Subnetting Explained
Subnetting is the process of dividing a larger network into smaller, manageable networks. Think of it like slicing a cake—there's only so much to go around, and you decide how to divide it among different groups.

Why Subnetting Matters
In real-world scenarios, organizations need to separate different groups or departments. For example, a business might have:

Accounting department
Finance department
Human Resources department
Subnetting allows network administrators to assign specific portions of the network to each department, making it easier to direct traffic to the right place.

How Subnetting Works
Subnetting is achieved using a subnet mask—a number that determines how the IP address is divided between the network and host portions.

IP Addresses and Subnet Masks
An IP address consists of four sections called octets (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
A subnet mask also has four octets (e.g., 255.255.255.0)
Each octet ranges from 0 to 255 (representing 8 bits)32bits

Three Types of IP Addresses in a Subnet

Type----Network Address
Purpose----Identifies the start of the actual network
Example----192.168.1.0

Type----Host Address
Purpose----Identifies a specific device on the subnet
Example-----192.168.1.100

Type----Default Gateway
Purpose----The device that sends data to other networks
Example----192.168.1.254

Network Address
The network address identifies the beginning of a network. All devices within the same subnet share this prefix.

Example: A device with IP 192.168.1.100 belongs to the network 192.168.1.0
Host Address
A host address is assigned to individual devices (computers, printers, phones) on the network.

Example: 192.168.1.100 could be assigned to an employee's computer
Default Gateway
The default gateway is a special address that connects the local network to other networks (like the internet). Any data destined for a device outside the local network is sent here.

Convention: Usually the first (.1) or last (.254) host address in a network

When Do We Need Subnetting?
At Home
Most home networks use a single subnet because having more than 254 devices connected at once is unlikely. A typical home subnet looks like:
Network: 192.168.1.0
Usable hosts: 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.254 (254 devices)

In Business
Offices and businesses have many more devices:
Desktop computers
Laptops
Printers
Security cameras
Sensors
Smart devices
In these environments, subnetting becomes essential to manage large numbers of devices efficiently.
