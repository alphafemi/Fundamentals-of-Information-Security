💿How Blu-Ray and Optical Discs Work Documentation
Blu-ray is a modern optical disc technology descended from LaserDisc, part of a family including CDs and DVDs. This guide explains how optical discs store and read data using lasers, binary encoding, and varying laser wavelengths. Based on the transcript, it covers the mechanics, data storage, and evolution of these media.

Overview of Optical Discs
Optical discs are storage media that use lasers to read data encoded on a disc's surface.
Examples: CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray, and emerging Ultra HD Blu-ray.
Form Factor: All share a similar physical shape; read by laser-based devices.
Purpose: Store data like movies, music, or files in binary format.

      How Optical Discs Store Data
Data is encoded as physical pits and flat areas on the disc's layer.
Binary Encoding:
Pit: Represents 0 (zero).
Flat Area: Represents 1 (one).
Reading Process:
A laser shines on the spinning disc.
Light reflects from flat areas to a photoelectric cell (detects as 1).
Light does not reflect from pits (detects as 0).
Output: Binary data is interpreted by a computer as files, videos, or audio.
 
    Storage Capacity and Laser Technology
Capacity depends on pit size and laser precision.
Factors:
Smaller pits allow more data on the same area.
Laser wavelength determines beam precision.
Laser Types:
CDs: Infrared lasers (longer wavelength, less precise).
DVDs: Red lasers (shorter wavelength than CDs).
Blu-ray: Blue lasers (shortest wavelength, most precise).
Capacity Comparison: Blu-ray stores ~5 times more data than DVD due to blue laser precision.
Generations:
First: CDs.
Second: DVDs.
Third: Blu-ray.
Fourth: Emerging Ultra HD Blu-ray (poised to replace standard Blu-ray).


          Evolution and Future
Optical discs have evolved with technology advancements.
History: Descended from LaserDisc; Blu-ray improves on DVD.
Current Status: Blu-ray is widely used; Ultra HD Blu-ray is the next step.
Limitations: Physical media; susceptible to scratches, but reliable for archival storage.
