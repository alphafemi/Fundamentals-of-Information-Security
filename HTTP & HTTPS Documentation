are foundational protocols for web communication, enabling the transmission of web content. This guide explains HTTP, HTTPS, their differences, and security implications. Based on the transcript, these protocols govern how browsers and web servers exchange data, with HTTPS providing essential encryption and verification.

Overview
HTTP and HTTPS are application-layer protocols used for communicating with web servers to transmit webpage data.

Purpose: Transfer web content (HTML, images, videos) between clients (browsers) and servers.
Developer: Tim Berners-Lee and team (1989-1991); foundation of the World Wide Web.
Usage: Every website访问 involves these protocols (explicit in URLs like http:// or https://).
Importance: Enable web browsing; HTTPS secures communications against eavesdropping and impersonation.

    HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is the standard, unsecured protocol for web communication.
Definition: Set of rules for transmitting webpage data between clients and servers.

Function: Sends requests (e.g., GET for fetching pages) and responses (e.g., HTML, images).
Security: No encryption; data sent as plain text—anyone intercepting can read it.
Port: Default port 80 (though not always used).
Limitations: Vulnerable to eavesdropping, tampering, and man-in-the-middle attacks; no server verification.
Use: Development/testing; non-sensitive content; legacy systems.

      HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure)
HTTPS is the secure, encrypted version of HTTP for safe communication.
Definition: HTTP with TLS/SSL encryption for data protection.

Function: Encrypts data in transit; ensures privacy and integrity.
Security Benefits:
Encryption: Prevents interception (e.g., passwords, personal data).
Server Verification: Confirms identity—protects against impersonation (e.g., fake banking sites).
Data Integrity: Prevents modification during transmission.
Port: Default port 443 (standard secure port).
Implementation: Uses SSL/TLS certificates; browsers show padlock icons for secure connections.
Use: Sensitive sites (banking, email, e-commerce); required for modern web standards.

  🌐    HTTP METHOD
HTTP methods specify the type of action to be performed on a resource (e.g., a webpage, file, or data record). Each method has a specific purpose, and servers respond accordingly.

Purpose: Communicate intent; server processes requests based on the method used.
Common Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE cover most web interactions.
Use Cases: Retrieving data, submitting forms, updating records, removing entries.
Importance: Fundamental to web development, APIs, and client-server communication.

      GET Request
GET is used to retrieve information from a web server without modifying any data.
Definition: Requests data from a specified resource.
Characteristics: Data is sent in the URL query string (visible in the address bar); no request body.
Example: Visiting https://example.com/page retrieves the webpage content.
Use: Fetching webpages, images, API data; searching (e.g., search query in URL).
Safety: Idempotent—calling GET multiple times produces the same result (no side effects).
Analogy: Like reading a book—you request it, but don't change anything.

      POST Request
POST is used to submit data to the web server, often creating new records.
Definition: Sends data to be processed to a specified resource.
Characteristics: Data is sent in the request body (not visible in the URL); can handle large amounts of data.
Example: Submitting a login form, creating a new user account, uploading a file.
Use: Form submissions; creating resources; sending sensitive data (passwords not in URL).
Safety: Not idempotent—submitting POST multiple times may create duplicate records.
Analogy: Like filling out a form and submitting it—the server processes and often creates something new.

        PUT Request
PUT is used to update existing information on the web server.
Definition: Replaces or updates an existing resource at a specified URI.
Characteristics: Sends data in the request body; replaces the entire resource if it exists.
Example: Updating a user profile, replacing a document with new content.
Use: Modifying existing records; full updates to resources.
Safety: Idempotent—calling PUT multiple times produces the same result (updates to the same state).
Analogy: Like replacing an old document with a completely new one.

        DELETE Request
DELETE is used to remove information or records from the web server.
Definition: Deletes the specified resource from the server.
Characteristics: May send data in the URL or body to identify what to delete.
Example: Removing a user account, deleting a comment, clearing a file.
Use: Permanently removing data; managing resources.
Safety: Idempotent—deleting a resource multiple times results in the same state (resource already gone).
Analogy: Like throwing away a file—once removed, it's gone.



      HTTP Status Codes:
100-199: Information Responses
Information responses are transitional codes that indicate the server has received the initial part of the request and is waiting for the client to continue.
Purpose: Used in early HTTP implementations for chunked transfers; now largely obsolete.
Current Relevance: Rare in modern web applications; most clients do not encounter these codes.
Example: 100 Continue (client should proceed with the full request).

200-299: Success Responses
Success codes confirm that the client's request was successfully processed by the server.
200 OK: The request was completed successfully. This is the most common status code for successful HTTP requests.
201 Created: A new resource was successfully created on the server. Commonly returned after form submissions or API calls that create records (e.g., new user registration, blog post creation).
Use Cases: Retrieving webpages, submitting forms, creating API resources.

300-399: Redirection Responses
Redirection codes instruct the client to access a different resource, either temporarily or permanently.
301 Moved Permanently: The requested resource has permanently moved to a new URL. Browsers should update bookmarks, and search engines should transfer ranking to the new location.
302 Found: A temporary redirect indicating the resource currently resides at a different URL but may return to the original location in the future. Used for temporary maintenance or A/B testing.
Use Cases: URL shortening, website migrations, load balancing, temporary resource hosting.

400-499: Client Error Responses
Client error codes indicate problems with the client's request. These errors typically require the client to修正 their request before retrying.
400 Bad Request: The server cannot process the request due to malformed syntax, missing parameters, or invalid request framing. The client must modify their request to proceed.
401 Not Authorised: Access to the requested resource requires authentication. The client must provide valid credentials (e.g., username and password) to proceed.
403 Forbidden: The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it. Unlike 401, authentication will not help—the client simply does not have permission, whether logged in or not.
404 Not Found: The requested resource could not be found on the server. This may occur for deleted pages, mistyped URLs, or resources that never existed.
405 Method Not Allowed: The HTTP method used (e.g., GET, POST) is not supported for the requested resource. For example, sending a GET request to an endpoint that only accepts POST requests.
Use Cases: Invalid inputs, authentication failures, missing pages, unsupported methods.

500-599: Server Error Responses
Server error codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request due to internal problems.
500 Internal Service Error: A generic error message indicating the server encountered an unexpected condition. This is often caused by application bugs, misconfigurations, or resource exhaustion.
503 Service Unavailable: The server is temporarily unable to handle the request. This is commonly due to server overload, scheduled maintenance, or temporary outages. The server may include a Retry-After header to indicate when to retry.
Use Cases: Server crashes, database timeouts, maintenance windows, traffic spikes.


Common HTTP Status Codes:

There are a lot of different HTTP status codes and that's not including the fact that applications can even define their own, we'll go over the most common HTTP responses you are likely to come across:

200 - OK	The request was completed successfully.
201 - Created	A resource has been created (for example a new user or new blog post).
301 - Moved Permanently	This redirects the client's browser to a new webpage or tells search engines that the page has moved somewhere else and to look there instead.
302 - Found	Similar to the above permanent redirect, but as the name suggests, this is only a temporary change and it may change again in the near future.
400 - Bad Request	This tells the browser that something was either wrong or missing in their request. This could sometimes be used if the web server resource that is being requested expected a certain parameter that the client didn't send.
401 - Not Authorised	You are not currently allowed to view this resource until you have authorised with the web application, most commonly with a username and password.
403 - Forbidden	You do not have permission to view this resource whether you are logged in or not.
405 - Method Not Allowed	The resource does not allow this method request, for example, you send a GET request to the resource /create-account when it was expecting a POST request instead.
404 - Page Not Found	The page/resource you requested does not exist.
500 - Internal Service Error	The server has encountered some kind of error with your request that it doesn't know how to handle properly.
503 - Service Unavailable	
This server cannot handle your request as it's either overloaded or down for maintenance.
